# URL Shortener using Python

This is my second task from my Python development internship. I've created a simple URL shortener using Python. The goal was to take long URLs and generate shorter, more manageable versions.

## How it works

1. **User Input**: The user provides a long URL.
2. **Shortening Algorithm**: The Python script generates a unique short code for the URL. This code is usually a combination of letters and numbers.
3. **Database or Data Structure**: The script stores the mapping between the short code and the original long URL in a database or data structure (e.g., dictionary).
4. **Redirecting**: When someone accesses the short URL, the script looks up the corresponding long URL and redirects the user to that page.

## Implementation Details

- I used Python's built-in libraries to handle HTTP requests and create a simple web server.
- For generating short codes, I used a combination of random characters.
- The database (or data structure) stores the mapping between short codes and long URLs.

## Example Usage

1. User provides a long URL: `https://www.example.com/this-is-a-very-long-url-that-needs-shortening`.
2. Script generates a short code: `abc123`.
3. When someone accesses `myshorturl.com/abc123`, they are redirected to `https://www.example.com/this-is-a-very-long-url-that-needs-shortening`.
